Repository with general information about Q-Rapids H2020 project and the software components produced. The aim of the project is produce an evidence-based, data-driven quality-aware rapid software development method where quality requirements are incrementally elicited, refined and improved based on data gathered from software repositories, management tools, system usage and quality of service. This data is analysed and aggregated into quality-related strategic indicators which are presented in a highly informative dashboard.

# Components

| Repository | Name | Description | Lead Organization |
| ---| ---- | ----------- | :-------------:| 
| [qrapids-dashboard](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-dashboard) | Q-Rapids Strategic Dashboard | A dashboard for visualizing the quality of the company's products. This **strategic** dashboard is complemented with some specific features to support decision-makers managing **quality requirements**. | UPC|
| [qrapids-forecast](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-forecast) | Q-Rapids Forecasting | A library that provides forecasting for metrics and factors that are used to assess quality of the company's products. | UPC|
| [qrapids-forecast-rest](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-forecast-rest) | Q-Rapids Forecasting RESTful services| RESTful services that provides forecasting for metrics and factors that are used to assess quality of the company's products. This component integrates the  [qrapids-forecast](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-forecast) and it is used by the [qrapids-dashboard](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-dashboard). | UPC |
| [qrapids-forecast-R_script](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-forecast-R_script) | Forecasting R script | This repository contains an R script file complementing the forecasting techniques included by default in the [qrapids-forecast](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-forecast) repository. | UPC|
| [qrapids-si_assessment](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-si_assessment) | Q-Rapids Qualitative SI assessment | A library that provides assessment for the strategic indicators using Bayesian Networks, strategic indicators are the higher level of indicators used to assess quality of the company's products. | UPC |
| [qrapids-si_assessment-rest](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-si_assessment-rest) | Q-Rapids Qualitative SI assessment RESTful services| RESTful services that provides qualitative assessment for the strategic indicators that are used to assess quality of the company's products. This component integrates the  [qrapids-si_assessment](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-si_assessment) and it is used by the [qrapids-dashboard](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-dashboard). | UPC |
| [qrapids-qma-elastic](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-qma-elastic) | Quality Model Assessment | A library to read and write the assessment data from an Elasticsearch. This library is integrated in the [qrapids-dashboard](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-dashboard). | UPC|
| [qrapids-qr_generation](https://github.com/q-rapids/qr_generation) | Quality Requirements Generator | A library that generates the quality requirements candidates. This library uses the external tool [PABRE-WS](https://github.com/OpenReqEU/requirement-patterns) for managing a quality requirement patterns catalogue. | UPC|
| [qrapids-connect](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-connect) | Connectors | Apache Kafka connectors for ingesting data from heterogeneous data sources. It includes an example of an Apache Kafka Connector that collects Issues and Measures from Sonarqube. | Fraunhofer IESE |
| [qrapids-eval](https://github.com/q-rapids/qrapids-eval) | Quality model tool support | It defines a quality model by aggregating the raw data into metrics, and further on into factors. The quality model can be customised and/or replaced in different companies, working as a plug-in, allowing the creation of quality models based on expert knowledge or data mining analysis techniques. | Fraunhofer IESE |
